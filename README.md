## Business Problem
Customer churn directly affects revenue and long-term growth.  
This project answers key business questions:
- What is the overall churn rate?
- Which customer segments churn the most?
- How much revenue is lost due to churn?
- Which high-value customers should be prioritized for retention?

---

## Project Workflow
1. Generated a large-scale, realistic customer dataset.
2. Stored and queried data using SQL for churn and revenue analysis.
3. Performed exploratory data analysis to identify churn drivers.
4. Built a churn prediction model with explainable features.
5. Created churn risk scores and segmented customers by business risk.
6. Exported dashboard-ready datasets for BI tools.
